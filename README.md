## Overview
Let's talk about some beginner-friendly projects you can work on:

## Why learn Python for Finance
Python is widely used across industries due to its open-source capabilities. Python is challenging to learn in the first 6 months, after that period you will be quite good. Start attaching your progress to github & you will soon realise how far long you've come. I am cheering for you!
